Welcome to my first official blog post y'all. Before I begin, let me just take a moment to say RIP to Robin Williams. Love you man.

I'm sure you've read through my scintillating <a href="http://mattbatista.io/about">about</a> page and got a sense of who I am and what I am about. If you didn't, click that link fam!

My own coding journey has been a long one, and I'm very much still on it. If you're joining me at the beginning of your own journey, then let me be the first developer to welcome you with loving arms.

If you stick around, you'll start to notice how fantastic this community is. There's this underlying willingness to lend a helping hand to complete newbies which I think sets the field of programming apart from a lot of professions.

In part, that's one of the big reasons why this field strikes such a chord with me. It's one of the reasons why I chose to switch careers and become a developer.

All of us start out as beginners. Everyone. I know how daunting it can be starting out, and I am no stranger to feeling completely lost.

As I learn and grow as a person and as a developer, I want to leave breadcrumbs to those that will follow in my stead (that could be you). I'm no expert. I will make mistakes. But together, we will learn from them and level up. This blog will be a medley of code snippets and personal ramblings about whatevs.

I can't stress this enough, if you're new to programming or just starting out, this blog is for you. Let's be friends! I will try my best to thoroughly write down my experiences and struggles. As I navigate the ever changing landscape of web development, it is my sincerest hope that maybe, just maybe, my words will help you out in some way.

Don't be afraid to send me some love via the comments.
