*What's up, my name is at the top of the page in case you're wondering. Below you'll find my handsome mugshot and a bit of my coding origin story.*

![It's ya boy!](http://i.imgur.com/wppdcGF.jpg)

###TL;DR
I am a <code>web developer</code> with experience in <code>Ruby</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>jQuery</code>, the dynamic duo <code>HTML/CSS</code>, and MVC frameworks such as <code>Ruby on Rails</code>.
<br>

I want a few things:

- To leave code in much better shape than I found it
- To surround myself with challenges and people that enrich what I know already so I can level-up
- To mentor anyone on their own coding journey whenever, and however I can. This community has my back, I'm just returning the favor <code>:)</code>

## Le Coding Origin

I suppose it all started when I was in the womb. Instead of floating around for nine months doing nothing, I decided to take action. In order to stave off boredom, I made a computer with spare parts I found floating around the amniotic fluid. It wasn't much, but I was able to MacGyver a decent laptop with 1GB of RAM. I powered it mainly through oxygen I got from my umbilical cord (tutorial video coming soon). Self-teaching and a lot of all-nighters made me proficient in placenta.js and zygoteDB. <em>Lol</em>.

All joking aside, my origin story doesn't paint me as someone who got started in programming at an early age.

Three years ago, one of my best friends was finishing up a stint @ Hack Reactor in San Francisco and had **a lot** of amazing stories about his coding journey and experience. This same friend is apart of a close-knit group of friends that I've had for many moons (think: elementary school). A few of us got together and began to have a dialogue about technology and where our place could be in this gargantuan  and evolving field.

We shared a lot about how unsatisfied we were with our current careers, 20-somethings still trying to figure stuff out. We talked about being able to build intangible wonders used and loved by people around the world. Our eyes widened at the sheer demand for programmers, and how San Francisco is a mecca for newcomers to get their careers started. All we had to do was learn *"how to code"*, and we could craft something that brings immense value to people. **_Whoa_**.

##I had a lot of questions and the answers led me to to these revelations

<br>
***Someone like me, with nothing but retail experience and little programming know-how, can make a career change into tech and fundamentally change not only my quality of life, but give it real challenge and excitement.***

I want to write code that has use. Every time I hear someone say "_How did I ever live life without X, Y, or Z technologies_" it makes my synapses fire off. I've said this countless times myself. I want to have a hand in creating something sensational that instills similar feelings in others.

It became clear that this was a path I definitely wanted to embark on. Although I didn't fully grasp the Sisyphean task learning to code was going to be, I relished the moment where I can add <code>software engineer</code> to my job title. That's the goal I set for myself. A goal without a plan though, is just a wish.

I had to enter the labyrinth that is **learning to code**:

I chose Ruby as my starting language; it's built for programmer happiness and has a rock solid community of developers more than willing to offer their expertise free of charge.

I threw myself at every tutorial I could find. I read **TONS** of blogs from developers about their hurdles on their coding journey. I listened to podcasts. I watched YouTube vids. I kept a notebook of methods, definitions, code snippets, design patterns. The good ole' shotgun approach. I was all over the place.

I wasn't alone in this coding journey, my other friends got involved as well. We decided to meet everyday and study together. We went over coding challenges, language syntax and best practices, white boarding, object-oriented construction of games. We struggled a hell of a lot and were extremely lucky we had someone who could mentor us through difficult hurdles that came up.

As a milestone project, we got together and decided to build our very first Rails application from start to finish and deploy it to production. Learning about version control with Git was an absolute must. From concept to execution, we collaborated and struggled together for the next few months.

After many errors and frustrations, we had a shiny Rails web application that addressed the needs of the online gaming community. It connected players who wanted to play the same game,  together. A lot of the time, the matchmaking that comes built in doesn't cut the mustard. Thus, [Supreme LFG](http://www.supremelfg.com) (looking for group) was born!

Such a bitter sweet learning experience, but I knew I needed to fast-track my learning. My amigos and I researched around for a well rounded Ruby/Rails bootcamp curriculum and decided to apply and see where it took us. Some Skype interviews and a few coding challenges later, I got accepted! The bootcamp required my undivided attention for the next 3 months.

With an absurd amount of fear that I was somehow making the wrong choice, I quit my comfortable job @ Apple and put myself through a rigorous **1,000 hour** software development course in San Francisco.

***The hardest endeavor I think I've ever attempted in my life.***

The pace of the program and immense amount of learning was crushing at times. I felt like I didn't belong next to my peers who came in with PhDs in mathematics or who had prior programming experience to give them that *edge*. Not only that, there was the added pressure of failing and having nothing to show for it.

**Stress! Stress! Stress!** The program challenged the hell out of me and brought me to the brink of madness many times. I had to keep my eye on the prize at all costs.

I did, and now I'm here. That goal that long ago seemed so far away, is now within my grasp. Out of gratitude for the countless people who have helped me through my hurdles, I felt it only right that I give back to the coding community as much as I possible can (one of the big reasons for getting a blog going). It's important to me that I help other new developers if and when I can.

I've never been so close to achieving something I've wanted so badly. Getting hired to develop and write code that others will find useful and enjoy seemed impossible 3 years ago. Now, it's all I think about.

Thanks for taking the time to read this mini novel. **Stay golden**
