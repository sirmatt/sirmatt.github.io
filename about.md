*What's up, my name is at the top of the page in case you're wondering. Below you'll find my handsome mugshot and a bit of my coding origin story.*

The biggest takeaway I want you to glean is this: I am a budding <code>web developer</code> who wants to learn as much as I can, contribute meaningfully, and maybe inspire others on their own coding journey. What a time to be alive!

I suppose it all started when I was in the womb. Nine months is a long time. In order to stave off boredom, I made a computer with spare parts I found floating around the amniotic fluid. It wasn't much, but I was able to build a decent machine. I powered it mainly through oxygen I got from my umbilical cord (tutorial video coming soon). Self-teaching, patience, and a little classical music via the outside world made me proficient in placenta.js and zygoteDB.

All joking aside, my origin story doesn't paint me as someone who was *programming all their life*.

Here's me being honest: I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do out of high school. Crazy thing about feeling lost, is you never know where the path will take you. A gentle meandering through community college GE courses and a myriad of retail positions began to get claustrophobic.

To quote one of my great teachers, Mr. Dixon:

> "*If your friends play basketball, you'll play basketball*"

The mark of a great friend is someone who can *convince* you that your limits, like fears, are often just an illusion. My friends sparked that initial coding curiosity. We learned, struggled, collaborated, and had hella fun -- and we did it all together. That alone fanned the flames to push me to make the switch to developing as a career.

Easier said then done. The road is long and fraught with *'what next?'* moments left and right. I kept a journal of programming notes from when I first started my coding journey and let me tell you -- I was all over the place. Literally, I was stumbling around in the dark like Bilbo Baggins under the Misty Mountains.

Coding is damn tough. Getting started was even tougher.

* Figuring out what language to start with
* Configuring your computer to actually do stuff
* Text editor standalone? IDE?
* Deciding when to move on to learning something new
* What's important to know now, and what's not
* Algorithms, git, version control, buzz words, libraries - - ! !

Believe me, I battle with those feelings even today. There's still so much I don't know and I love that; it means there's something more to discover and learn.

I cannot wait to hit the ground running and start providing real value to make a difference.

Thanks for stopping by.
