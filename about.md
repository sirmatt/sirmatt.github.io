*What's up, my name is at the top of the page in case you're wondering. Below you'll find my handsome mugshot and a bit of my coding origin story.*

The biggest takeaway I want you to glean is this: I am a budding <code>junior web developer</code> who wants to learn as much as I can, contribute meaningfully, and maybe inspire others on their own coding journey. What a time to be alive!

I suppose it all started when I was in the womb. Nine months is a long time. In order to stave off boredom, I made a computer with spare parts I found floating around the amniotic fluid. It wasn't much, but I was able to build a decent machine. I powered it mainly through oxygen I got from my umbilical cord (tutorial video coming soon). Self-teaching, patience, and a little classical music via the outside world made me proficient in placenta.js and zygoteDB.

All joking aside, my origin story doesn't paint me as someone who was *programming all their life*. I don't have memories of me using old computer tech to build stuff or being enamored with cryptic programming languages.

Allow me to be vulnerable for a sec. I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do out of high school. The thing about feeling lost, is you never know where the path will take you. A gentle meandering through community college GE courses and a myriad of retail positions began to get claustrophobic.

To quote one of my great teachers Mr. Dixon:

> "*If your friends play basketball, you'll play basketball*"

I have the most diabolically sensational friends; they're more like brothers. That quote above is incredibly accurate but in my case, replace **play basketball** with **enjoy programming**. I didn't need much convincing to make the switch to developing as a career. The times we live in are filled with such sweet potential. Any one of us can contribute to something amazing and get compensated well, all we need is to learn to code.

Easier said then done. I kept a journal of programming notes from when I first started my coding journey and let me tell you, I was all over the place. Literally, I was stumbling around in the dark like Bilbo Baggins under the Misty Mountains.

Choosing to enroll in a coding bootcamp opened my eyes to invaluable possibilities. There would be delicious structure, wise instructors, hands-on experience, and a network of my fellow peers who were just like me: *frightened code newbies* who believed they can change the world.

Coding is damn tough. Trying to figure out what language to start with is tough. Or even trying to decide when to move on to something else. Do you know enough to move on? How do you know? What's the next step? Oh crap, you need to be a whiz in math don't you?!

Believe me, I battle with those feelings even today. There's still so much I don't know and I love that. It means there's always a way to improve. Becoming a web developer seems like a sisyphean task. Unlike Sisyphus, every day I push myself to achieve makes that boulder a little lighter; it makes that hill a little less steep.

I cannot wait to hit the ground running and start providing real value to make a difference. May the Force be with me.

Thanks for stopping by
