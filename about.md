*What's up, my name is at the top of the page in case you're wondering. Below you'll find my handsome mugshot and a bit of my coding origin story.*

The biggest takeaway I want you to glean is this:

I am a budding <code>web developer</code> who wants to learn as much as I can, contribute meaningfully, provide value, and maybe inspire others on their own coding journey. What a time to be alive!

I suppose it all started when I was in the womb. Instead of floating around for nine months doing nothing, I decided to take action. In order to stave off boredom, I made a computer with spare parts I found floating around the amniotic fluid. It wasn't much, but I was able to MacGyver a decent laptop with 1GB of RAM. I powered it mainly through oxygen I got from my umbilical cord (tutorial video coming soon). Self-teaching and a lot of all-nighters made me proficient in placenta.js and zygoteDB. Lol.

All joking aside, my origin story doesn't paint me as someone who was *programming at an early age*.

Here's me being honest: I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do out of high school. Crazy thing about being lost, is you never know where the path will take you. A gentle meandering through community college and a myriad of retail positions began to get claustrophobic. Then one day, my friends opened a doorway that hasn't shut since.

To quote one of my great teachers, Mr. Dixon:

> "*If your friends play basketball, you'll play basketball*"

The mark of a great friend is someone who can *convince* you that your limits, like fears, are often just an illusion. My friends sparked that initial coding curiosity. We learned, struggled, collaborated, and had hella fun -- and we did it all together. That alone fanned the flames to push me to make the switch to developing as a career.

Easier said then done. I threw myself at any learning material I could get my hands on. I knew I wanted to start with <code>Ruby + Rails</code>, and that was just the beginning. I applied to App Academy in San Francisco and got in; less than 5% acceptance rate...**whoa**.

I kept a journal of programming notes from when I first started my coding journey and let me tell you -- I was all over the place. Literally I was stumbling around, in the dark, like Bilbo Baggins under the Misty Mountains.

Learning to code was/is the most mentally demanding endeavor I've ever attempted. There were hot, salty tears of despair whenever something went wrong (and something _ALWAYS_ managed to go wrong). It's tough out there. Believe me, I know.

* Figuring out what language to start with
* Configuring your computer to actually do stuff
* Text editor choice? IDE?
* Database errors, LOTS of them
* Deciding when to learn something new
* What's important to know now, and what's not
* Algorithms, version control, dependencies, object-oriented design, Big-O, polymorphism, RubyGems, test-driven development, Bundler, inheritance - - YIKES ! !

There's still *so* much I don't know and I'm OK with that. It means there's something more to discover and learn from. It means there's an opportunity to teach others and help them level up.

I cannot wait to hit the ground running and start providing real value. Thanks for stopping by.
